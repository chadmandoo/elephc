//! Purpose:
//! Unit tests for Phase 06 IR-level passes, built on hand-constructed EIR.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Functions are built with `crate::ir::Builder` so the tests exercise the
//!   real IR data model without going through AST lowering.
