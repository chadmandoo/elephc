//! Purpose:
//! Integration or regression tests for end-to-end codegen coverage of `get_debug_type()` — the
//! stdlib-prelude polyfill whose `get_class($mixed)` call once made the ENTIRE stdlib prelude
//! un-compilable natively.
//!
//! Called from:
//! - `cargo test` through Rust's test harness.
//!
//! Key details:
//! - Inline PHP fixtures are compiled to native binaries and assertions compare stdout against PHP.

/// Regression (#638): `get_debug_type()` must NATIVELY COMPILE.
///
/// The stdlib prelude's polyfill read:
///
///     function get_debug_type(mixed $value): string {
///         if (is_object($value)) { return get_class($value); }   // <-- un-lowerable
///         ...
///
/// `get_class()`'s lowering (`lower_class_name_lookup`) has no `PhpType::Mixed` arm and hard-errors
/// with "get_class for PHP type Mixed". And the value CANNOT be narrowed out of Mixed: elephc has no
/// "any object" PhpType — only `Object(ClassName)` — so neither `is_object()` nor even an `object`
/// type hint yields an object type. The call could therefore never lower.
///
/// Because the shared stdlib bundle injects all its functions together, that ONE call made every
/// program that triggers the prelude fail to compile natively — 114 of 1082 roots in the AIC survey,
/// the single largest native gap. It is also why `explode`/`strtr`/`arity_ext`/`substr_compare` were
/// each split into their own one-function preludes purely to avoid dragging this bundle in (see their
/// module docs).
///
/// Fix: use `$value::class`, which is identical for an object (the `is_object()` guard has just
/// established that) but desugars to the `__elephc_class_name_of` intrinsic, whose Mixed arm routes
/// to the `__rt_class_name_of` runtime helper.
///
/// NOTE: `--check` passed this all along — only a native compile ever saw it.
