`--web` is an elephc compiler extension: it compiles a standard PHP file into a
standalone prefork HTTP server binary instead of a plain CLI executable. The PHP
source you compile is standard PHP — the same file would also run under the PHP
interpreter or php-fpm — but the compile-and-serve mechanism is specific to
elephc.

## Compiling a web server

```bash
elephc --web app.php
# app.php -> app  (a self-contained HTTP server binary)
```

The produced binary has no PHP runtime dependency. Run it with `--listen`:

```bash
./app --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
./app --listen 127.0.0.1:8080 --workers 4
```

## Runtime arguments

The produced binary accepts these arguments at runtime:

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--listen host:port` | Yes | — | Address and port to bind. Missing `--listen` prints an error to stderr and exits non-zero. |
| `--workers N` | No | CPU count | Number of worker processes to prefork. Minimum 1. |

## Request model

The request model follows PHP-FPM / `php -S`: each incoming HTTP request
re-runs the program's top-level code from a completely fresh state. Whatever
the script writes via `echo` or `print` becomes the HTTP response body. The
default response is `200 OK` with no `Content-Type` set; the program controls
the status and headers with `http_response_code()` and `header()` (see
[Response control](#response-control)).

```php
<?php
echo "Hello from elephc-web!";
```

Compiled with `--web`, the binary above serves `Hello from elephc-web!` for
every request.

See `examples/web-hello/` for a minimal runnable demo.

## Request input

The HTTP request is exposed through standard PHP superglobals, rebuilt fresh on
every request and readable inside any function scope (no `global` needed):

- **`$_SERVER`** — `REQUEST_METHOD`, `REQUEST_URI`, `QUERY_STRING`, the request
  headers as `HTTP_*` keys (e.g. `HTTP_USER_AGENT`), and `CONTENT_TYPE` /
  `CONTENT_LENGTH` when present.
- **`$_GET`** — the query string parsed into a string-keyed array, percent-decoded.
- **`$_POST`** — an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` request body parsed the
  same way. Other content types leave `$_POST` empty — read the raw body via
  `php://input` instead.
- **`php://input`** — `file_get_contents('php://input')` returns the raw request
  body (e.g. a JSON payload). An empty body returns `false`.

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, " . ($_GET['name'] ?? 'world') . "!\n";
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    echo "Raw body: " . file_get_contents('php://input') . "\n";
}
```

See `examples/web-request/` for a runnable demo covering `$_SERVER`, `$_GET`,
`$_POST`, and `php://input`.

## Response control

The response status and headers are controlled with the standard PHP builtins,
behaving as they do under PHP-FPM:

- **`http_response_code(int $code = 0): int`** — with a code, sets the response
  status and returns the previous code; with no argument (or `0`), returns the
  current status without changing it. The default status is `200`.
- **`header(string $header, bool $replace = true, int $response_code = 0): void`** —
  adds a response header. The argument is the full `"Name: Value"` line, exactly
  as in PHP:
  - By default (`$replace = true`) a later `header()` with the same field name
    replaces earlier ones; pass `$replace = false` to send duplicates.
  - A `"HTTP/1.1 404 ..."` or `"Status: 404 ..."` line sets the status code
    instead of adding a header.
  - A `"Location: ..."` header also sets the status to `302`, unless the status
    is already `201`/`3xx` or the third `$response_code` argument overrides it.
  - The third `$response_code` argument, when non-zero, forces the status.

```php
<?php
header('Content-Type: application/json');
if (!isset($_GET['id'])) {
    http_response_code(400);
    echo '{"error":"missing id"}';
} else {
    echo '{"id":' . (int) $_GET['id'] . '}';
}
```

`Content-Type` is **not** set automatically — the program chooses it (PHP-FPM
defaults to `text/html`; elephc-web sets nothing unless you call `header()`).

See `examples/web-response/` for a runnable demo.

## Per-request fresh state

Between requests, the runtime resets all process-persistent state so request
N+1 sees the same clean environment request N did:

- **Global variables** — reset to their uninitialized state.
- **Function `static` variables** — released and zero-initialized; their
  initializers re-run on first call.
- **Static class properties** — released; their initializers re-run at the
  start of the handler body.

This matches PHP-FPM's per-request isolation model. No data leaks from one
request to the next.

## Concurrency model

The server uses a prefork model with `SO_REUSEPORT`: the master process forks N
worker processes before any request arrives, and the kernel load-balances
connections across workers.

Each worker is a separate process with its own copy of the runtime. Within a
single worker, requests are served **one at a time** — the PHP body runs to
completion before the next request is accepted. Parallelism equals the worker
count; a slow request occupies exactly one worker for its duration.

## Limitations

The serve loop, per-request fresh state, request input (`$_SERVER` / `$_GET` /
`$_POST` / `php://input`), and response control (`http_response_code()` /
`header()`) are available. The following are not yet available:

- **`$argc` / `$argv` not populated** — the binary's own argv is consumed by the
  server and is not forwarded to the script body.
- **`$_POST` only for urlencoded bodies** — `multipart/form-data` and file
  uploads are not parsed; read the raw body via `php://input` if you need it.
- **No intra-worker concurrency** — one slow request occupies its worker until
  it completes. Use `--workers` to increase throughput.
- **Not supported in this release (all phases):** cookies, sessions, static file
  serving, in-process TLS, HTTP/2–3.

## Mutual exclusions

`--web` cannot be combined with `--check`, `--emit cdylib`, `--emit-asm`, or
`--emit-ir`.
