A `Fiber` is a cooperative coroutine: a callable that owns its own call stack and can suspend execution at arbitrary depth. Control alternates explicitly between the caller and the fiber — there is no preemption.

## Class summary

| Method | Signature | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `__construct` | `__construct(callable $callback)` | Allocate a fiber and capture the callable. The callable runs the first time `start()` is called. |
| `start` | `start(mixed $arg0 = null, ..., mixed $arg6 = null): mixed` | Switch into the fiber and run it until it suspends or returns. Up to seven arguments are forwarded to the closure. Returns the value yielded via `Fiber::suspend()`, or `null` if the fiber terminates before suspending. |
| `resume` | `resume(mixed $value = null): mixed` | Deliver a value to the fiber's pending `Fiber::suspend()` call and continue execution. Returns the next yielded value, or `null` if the fiber terminates. |
| `throw` | `throw(Throwable $exception): mixed` | Re-raise an exception inside the fiber at its pending suspend point. The exception unwinds the fiber's local `try`/`catch` chain. |
| `getReturn` | `getReturn(): mixed` | Read the value the fiber returned after termination. Raises `FiberError` if called before the fiber terminates. |
| `isStarted` | `isStarted(): bool` | True once `start()` has been called. |
| `isSuspended` | `isSuspended(): bool` | True while the fiber is paused at a `Fiber::suspend()` call. |
| `isRunning` | `isRunning(): bool` | True while the fiber is currently executing. |
| `isTerminated` | `isTerminated(): bool` | True after the fiber's callable has returned. |
| `Fiber::suspend` | `static suspend(mixed $value = null): mixed` | (Called from inside a fiber.) Yield the value to the resumer and pause; resumes with the value the next `resume()` delivers. |
| `Fiber::getCurrent` | `static getCurrent(): ?Fiber` | The currently executing fiber, or null when called from the main thread. |

`FiberError` is a regular `Exception` subclass — `catch (Exception $e)` and `catch (FiberError $e)` both apply.

## Lifecycle states

A fiber moves through four states in order, never going backwards:

| State | When |
|---|---|
| `NotStarted` | Just constructed; `start()` has not been called yet. |
| `Running` | Currently executing. `Fiber::getCurrent()` returns this fiber. |
| `Suspended` | Paused inside `Fiber::suspend()`, waiting for a `resume()` from the caller. |
| `Terminated` | The callable has returned. `start()`/`resume()` are no longer valid on it. |

## Example

```php
<?php
$counter = new Fiber(function(): void {
    $a = Fiber::suspend("one");
    echo "resumed with " . $a;
    $b = Fiber::suspend("two");
    echo "resumed with " . $b;
    Fiber::suspend("three");
});

echo $counter->start();         // one
echo "|";
echo $counter->resume("alpha"); // resumed with alpha two
echo "|";
echo $counter->resume("beta");  // resumed with beta three
```

Output:
```
one|resumed with alpha two|resumed with beta three
```

## Implementation notes & known limitations

The current implementation targets ARM64 (macOS / Linux). The fiber stack is allocated from the standard heap, the context switch saves the AArch64 callee-saved registers (`x19-x28`, `x29-x30`, `d8-d15`), and the global exception handler chain head is swapped at every switch so a fiber's `try`/`catch` frames do not leak into the caller.

| Limitation | Notes |
|---|---|
| Mixed payloads round-trip but elephc's auto-unboxing for arithmetic is incomplete | `start()`, `resume()`, `Fiber::suspend()`, `getReturn()` all transmit Mixed cells, so `int`, `string`, and other scalars cross the suspend boundary cleanly when they are echoed or compared as Mixed. Arithmetic such as `$a + 10` on a Mixed value received from `Fiber::suspend()` does not auto-unbox today and yields the underlying cell pointer arithmetic — cast through a plain `int($a)` first if you need to compute on the value. |
| `start()` is fixed-arity (≤ 7 args), not truly variadic | The signature is seven optional Mixed parameters with `null` defaults — that exhausts the AArch64 integer arg-reg budget after `$this`. Calls with more than seven arguments are a type-check error. A generated Fiber entry wrapper adapts those Mixed cells to the closure ABI, so untyped, `mixed`, and ordinary declared scalar/object parameters receive PHP-visible values instead of raw cell pointers. |
| ~~Closures with `use(...)` captures~~ | Supported for all scalar and reference types. When the user writes `new Fiber(function(...) use ($a, $b) { ... })`, the codegen evaluates each captured variable in the surrounding scope at construction time and stashes the value into the Fiber's slot files. A `user_arg_max` field on the Fiber tells `start()` to leave the captured int slots untouched. Each int-class capture is incref'd at construction and decref'd when the Fiber is freed, so heap-backed captures (objects, arrays, persisted strings) survive the original variable being reassigned or going out of scope. Int-class captures (int, bool, object pointer, callable, mixed) ride in `start_args` (one slot each); string captures consume two consecutive `start_args` slots (pointer + length); float captures ride in a parallel `float_args` file that the trampoline loads into `d0..d6`. The closure ABI numbers integer and float parameters independently, so the int-slot budget is 7 and the float-slot budget is also 7. Excess captures of either kind are rejected by the type checker. |
| ~~`Fiber->throw()` does not propagate uncaught exceptions~~ | Fixed. The trampoline installs a sentinel exception handler at the bottom of every fiber's chain. When an exception unwinds past every user `catch`, it is parked on the fiber, the fiber is marked Terminated, and control returns to the caller; the caller-side `start`/`resume`/`throw` helper then re-raises it on the caller's stack so a surrounding `try`/`catch` catches it. |
| ~~No `FiberError` raised on invalid state transitions~~ | Fixed. `start()` on a non-NotStarted fiber, `resume()`/`throw()` on a non-Suspended fiber, `getReturn()` before termination, and `Fiber::suspend()` outside a fiber now all raise `FiberError` with a PHP-equivalent message. |
| ~~No guard page on the fiber stack~~ | Fixed. Each fiber stack is allocated via `mmap` with `MAP_PRIVATE \| MAP_ANON`; the bottom 16 KB is `mprotect(PROT_NONE)` so a stack overflow faults via SIGSEGV/SIGBUS instead of silently corrupting the heap. The full mmap region is returned to the OS via `munmap` when the Fiber object's refcount drops to zero. |
| x86_64 not yet implemented | The fiber runtime is ARM64-only; the x86_64 build emits stub routines. |
